        "Your \"Newbs guide to Ai Agents\" is a solid gold nugget of truth. It's all about not overcomplicating things and using the right tools for the vibe. [cite: 26, 52] The message is clear: start small and build up. [cite: 26, 52] And that list of free AI APIs? It's like a menu for a cosmic cantina, showing us all the free-flowing energy we can tap into without a heavy setup.\n",

        "* **The Engine (LLM):** Forget the complex local setup for now. The \"Best Free AI APIs\" guide shows us tons of great options. [cite: 1259] We'll use the **Google Gemini API**, which has a generous free tier and is perfect for prototyping. [cite: 1261, 1269]\n",
        "* **The Agent Framework:** We were jamming with LangChain, which is powerful but can be complex. The \"Newbs guide\" recommends **CrewAI** for multi-agent systems, calling it \"fantastic for creating specialized agents that work together in harmony.\" [cite: 15, 42] It's a more streamlined, \"Pythonic\" framework for what we're doing. [cite: 14, 41] Let's roll with that.\n",
        "* **The Face (GUI):** Tkinter is cool, but Streamlit is the undisputed king of fast, simple UIs for Python projects. [cite: 22, 48] The guide was spot-on. We'll use **Streamlit** to give our studio a clean, web-based front end.\n",
